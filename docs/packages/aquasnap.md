## Description

AquaSnap greatly enhances the way you can arrange windows on your Desktop. It gives you the possibility to snap windows to the edges or to the corners of the desktop, set windows to remain on top, stretch windows and more. It is freeware for personal single-monitor use only.

This software requires a license for all options to be available, but there is a 60 minutes trial for it and there are free options as well.

Features:

- Window docking: Drag and Drop your windows to the sides or corners of the screen and they are automatically resized to fit one half or one quarter of the screen. Just like the built-in Aero Snap function of Windows 7 but with more possibilities! This is especially useful on a 4K monitor or on multiple monitors.
- Window tiling: When two windows are side by side, resizing one of them while pressing [Ctrl] will also resize the other one. It's an easy and powerful way to modify the layout of several tiled windows.
- Window snapping: AquaSnap allows you to easily align your windows by making them behave like magnets. This simple feature is the cornerstone of AquaSnap and has been carefully designed to assist you without getting in your way.
- Window stretching: This is another powerful way to quickly split your desktop space between several windows. Double-click on the edge of a window to maximize it in one direction. Do the same while pressing [Shift] to maximize it vertically or horizontally.
- Move windows together: Professional applications with complex UI often scatter small toolbox windows on your desktop. Keep them grouped and move them all at once. Move one window while pressing [Ctrl] and the whole group of adjacent windows will follow.
- Make it stay on top: This is the best way to have this window always visible while working on a fullscreen application. Shake a window to make it transparent and always on top. Shake it again to restore it's normal state.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
